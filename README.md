# Neural Networks

In order to run this file against different parameters, one can change

• the activation variable which can be found in train() method

• the max_iterations variable in train() method definition

• the learning_rate variable in train() method definition

• also update the method name self.__”name_of_activation_function used”(xyz…) which can be found in forward_pass() method every time the activation function is changed.
